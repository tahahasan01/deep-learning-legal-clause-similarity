The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights, except that from and after such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights. Until a Right is exercised, the holder of the Right, as such, will not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive divideds. As of November 7, 2007 115,699,129 shares of the Company's Common Stock were issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share on November 9, 2007 will receive one Series A Right and one Series B Right. As long as the Rights are attached to the Common Shares, the Company will issue one Series A Right and one Series B Right for each Common Share issued between the Record Date and the Distribution Date. The Rights may have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, the Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by a majority of the Board of Directors since the Rights may be redeemed by the Company at any time prior to the Distribution Date. Thus, the Rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of the Company to initiate such an acquisition through negotiations with the Board of Directors. However, the effect of the Rights may be to discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial position in the equity securities of, or seeking to obtain control of, the Company. To the extent any potential acquisition is deterred by the Rights, the Rights may have the effect of preserving incumbent management in office. In certain events specified in the Rights Agreement, the Company is permitted to temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights.

This special exception to the “salary basis” requirements for FLSA’s exemption extends only to an eligible employee’s use of FMLA leave. It is unlawful for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise any right provided by the FMLA. It is also unlawful for an employer to discharge or discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice, or because of involvement in any proceeding, related to the FMLA. See Fact Sheet 77B: Protections for Individuals under the FMLA. The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administering and enforcing the FMLA for most employees. Most federal and certain congressional employees are also covered by the law but are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or Congress.
