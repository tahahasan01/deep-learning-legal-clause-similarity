Collection of the fees by TIPS is required under Texas Government Code §791.011 Et seq. Fees are due on all TIPS purchases reported by either Vendor or Member.

Vendor, Reseller or Vendor Assigned Dealer agrees that the participation fee is due to TIPS for all Agreement sales immediately upon receipt of payment including partial payment, from the Member Entity and must be paid to TIPS at least on a monthly basis, specifically within 31 calendar days of receipt of payment, if not more frequently, or as otherwise agreed by TIPS in writing and signed by an authorized signatory of TIPS. Thus, when an awarded Vendor, Reseller or Vendor Assigned Dealer receives any amount of payment, even partial payment, for a TIPS sale, the legally effective fee for that amount is immediately due to TIPS from the Vendor and fees due to TIPS should be paid at least on a monthly basis, specifically within 31 calendar days of receipt of payment, if not more frequently.",payments

"Payments. Each payment I make on this note will first reduce the amount I owe you for charges which are neither interest nor principal. The remainder of each payment will then reduce accrued unpaid interest, and then unpaid principal. If you and I agree to different application of payments, we will describe our agreement on this note. I may prepay a part of, or the entire balance of this loan without penalty, unless we specify to the contrary on this note. Any partial prepayment will not excuse or reduce any later scheduled payment until this note is paid in full (unless, when I make the prepayment, you and I agree in writing to the contrary). INTEREST: Interest accrues on the principal remaining unpaid from time to time, until paid in full. If I receive the principal in more than one advance, each advance will start to earn interest only when I receive the advance. The interest rate in effect on this note at any given time will apply to the entire principal advanced at that time. You and I may provide in this agreement for accrued interest not paid when due to be added to principal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, I do not agree to pay and you do not intend to charge any rate of interest that is higher than the maximum rate of interest you could charge under applicable law for the extension of credit that is agreed to here (either before or after maturity). If any notice of interest accrual is sent and is in error, we mutually agree to correct it, and if you actually collect more interest than allowed by law and this agreement, you agree to refund it to me.",payments

"Payments. In Kind"". The Prospectus states that payment for shares tendered for redemption is ordinarily made in cash. However, under certain circumstances the Board of Trustees of the Fund may determine that it would be detrimental to the best interests of the remaining shareholders of the Fund to make payment of a redemption order wholly or partly in cash. In that case, the Fund may pay the redemption proceeds in whole or in part by a distribution ""in kind"" of liquid securities from the portfolio of the Fund, in lieu of cash. The Fund has elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment Company Act. Under that rule, the Fund is obligated to redeem shares solely in cash up to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the net assets of the Fund during any 90-day period for any one shareholder. If shares are redeemed in kind, the redeeming shareholder might incur brokerage or other costs in selling the securities for cash. The Fund will value securities used to pay redemptions in kind using the same method the Fund uses to value its portfolio securities described above under ""Determination of Net Asset Values Per Share."" That valuation will be made as of the time the redemption price is determined. Involuntary Redemptions. The Fund's Board of Trustees has the right to cause the involuntary redemption of the shares held in any account if the aggregate net asset value of those shares is less than $500 or such lesser amount as the Board may fix. The Board will not cause the involuntary redemption of shares in an account if the aggregate net asset value of such shares has fallen below the stated minimum solely as a result of market fluctuations. If the Board exercises this right, it may also fix the requirements for any notice to be given to the shareholders in question (not less than 30 days). The Board may alternatively set requirements for the shareholder to increase the investment, or set other terms and conditions so that the shares would not be involuntarily redeemed.",payments
