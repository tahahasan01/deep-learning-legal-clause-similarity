If, from any possible construction of any document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 5.09 and such document shall be automatically reformed and the interest payable shall be automatically reduced to the Highest Lawful Rate, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document.

The right to accelerate the maturity of the Notes does not include the right to accelerate any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Holders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of acceleration. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Notes so that the amount of interest on account of the Notes does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.",compliance-with-law
