If Lessor uses or applies all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Lessee shall within 10 days after written request therefor deposit monies with Lessor sufficient to restore said Security Deposit to the full amount required by this Lease. If the Base Rent increases during the term of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon written request from Lessor, deposit additional monies with Lessor so that the total amount of the Security Deposit shall at all times bear the same proportion to the increased Base Rent as the initial Security Deposit bore to the initial Base Rent.

The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the performance of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.

The said sum, if not applied toward the payment of rents in arrears or toward the payment of damages suffered by the Landlord by reason of the Tenant’s breach of the covenants, conditions and agreements of this Lease, is to be returned to Tenant without interest when this Lease is terminated, according to these terms, and in no event is the said Security Deposit to be returned until Tenant has vacated the Leased Premises and delivered possession to the Landlord.
