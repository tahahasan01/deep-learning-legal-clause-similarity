"Meetings. Our normal practice is to begin by gathering information (often called “intake”), which lasts from one to three sessions. During this time, you and your therapist can decide whether there is a good patient-therapist fit in order to meet your treatment goals. After that, you and your therapist will usually schedule a 53 to 55-minute session per week or every other week at a mutually agreed upon time, although sometimes sessions will be longer or more frequent. Fees depend on the amount of time each session lasts. There is a $150 fee for a session that lasts 40 to 50 minutes. There is a $200 fee for a session that lasts more than 53 minutes. In addition to appointments, it is our practice to charge this amount on a prorated basis for other professional services you may require, such as report writing, attendance at meetings or consultations with other professionals that you have authorized, preparation of records, or the time required to perform any other service which you may request of your therapist (including phone calls lasting more than 15 minutes and frequent texting). Please note that insurance may not pay for phone calls or texting, and you will be sent a bill for these fees. Reports, referral letters, recommendation letters, and frequent calls or texting will be billed in 15-minute increments at $25 per 15 minutes, unless such documents are related to an ongoing or upcoming court case. Legal related services are either those ordered by a court or those for which reporting on progress to a court or court officer is expected, or cases in which a subpoena is likely. For legal related services such as documents, depositions and court appearances, our fees are $200.00 per hour plus a $250.00 preparation fee. If services are provided any place other than our office, travel time is charged as part of our fee. We never purposely double-book our therapy schedules. Instead, we reserve a specific time for you to receive services. Because this time has been reserved specifically for you, we expect you to provide at least 48 hours’ notice if you need to cancel or reschedule the session. Sessions without 48 hours’ notice will be charged a $100 no-show fee. If you miss 3 sessions without giving us 48 hours’ notice, we will assume that you no longer wish to receive any services. Your regular standing appointment may be given to someone else at that time. As explained at the time you scheduled your first appointment, a credit card on file was required in order to r...",meetings
