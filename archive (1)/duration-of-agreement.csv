Association Representative Manager of Human Resources Teacher Personnel Treasurer Employee Relations Officer Vice President / Secretary Superintendent of Human Resources Local President Chair For the Board: For the Union: The Board and the teachers recognize that the funding of the Roman Catholic Separate School system in the Province is pro- vided primarily through a combination of Provincial grants and local taxation. They further recognize and agree that the viability of the system depends in part on the commitment of those persons eligible to be its tax supporters. Accordingly, it is expected that the OccasionalTeachers employed by the York Catholic District School Board, who are eligible to do so, will direct their property taxes to the support of the Roman Catholic Separate School system and they shall be encouraged to do so by the York Occasional Teachers’ Locals of OECTA. The Board agrees to consider and address individual situations wherein an occasional teacher could be eligible for less on a daily basis on a long term occasional assignment because of their years of experience and category placement. In these particular situa- tions the Board will not penalize the occasional teacher but will instead continue the higher of the two daily rates during the term of the assignment. The parties agree that the bonus is only available to daily occa- sional teachers and does not include time worked in a long term assignment. The Board shall determine the entitlement at the end of each school year and pay the bonuses to all eligible daily occasional teachers shortly thereafter. It is the intent of the Board to endeavour to maintain the occa- sional teachers’ list at its current level. In assigning the workload of daily occasional teachers the fol- lowing principles are to be upheld:",duration-of-agreement
