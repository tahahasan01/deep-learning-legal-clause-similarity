"Loans. Loans receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances, less net deferred loan fees and the allowance for loan losses. The Bank's real estate loan portfolio consists primarily of long-term loans, collateralized by first mortgages on single-family residences and multi-family residential properties located in the southern Indiana area and commercial real estate loans. In addition to real estate loans, the Bank makes commercial loans and consumer loans. Loan origination fees and certain direct costs of underwriting and closing loans are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the interest method. The accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. The Bank does not accrue interest on loans past due 90 days or more except when the estimated value of collateral and collection efforts are deemed sufficient to ensure full recovery. When a loan is placed on non accrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans, including specific impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is reasonably assured. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management's evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specified impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change in the near term.",loans
