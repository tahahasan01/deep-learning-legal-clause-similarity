For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement need not be amended and restated in its entirety, but only Schedule A and the Purchaser’s signature page hereto need be so amended and updated and executed by each of the Purchaser and the Company upon the occurrence of any such transfer of Transferee Securities. 5.",transfer
