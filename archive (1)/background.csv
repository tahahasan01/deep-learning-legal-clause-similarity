"BACKGROUND. This document contains final regulations regarding the proposed amendments to 26 CFR part 1 under section 860E of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations provide the circumstances under which a transferor of a noneconomic REMIC residual interest meeting the investigation and representation requirements may avail itself of the safe harbor by satisfying either the formula test or the asset test. Final regulations governing REMICs, issued in 1992, contain rules governing the transfer of noneconomic REMIC residual interests. In general, a transfer of a noneconomic residual interest is disregarded for all tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transfer is to enable the transferor to impede the assessment or collection of tax. A purpose to impede the assessment or collection of tax (a wrongful purpose) exists if the transferor, at the time of the transfer, either knew or should have known that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the REMIC's taxable income. Under a safe harbor, the transferor of a REMIC noneconomic residual interest is presumed not to have a wrongful purpose if two requirements are satisfied: (1) the transferor conducts a reasonable investigation of the transferee's financial condition (the investigation requirement); and (2) the transferor secures a representation from the transferee to the effect that the transferee understands the tax obligations associated with holding a residual interest and intends to pay those taxes (the representation requirement). The IRS and Treasury have been concerned that some transferors of noneconomic residual interests claim they satisfy the safe harbor even in situations where the economics of the transfer clearly indicate the transferee is unwilling or unable to pay the tax associated with holding the interest. For this reason, on February 7, 2000, the IRS published in the Federal Register (65 FR 5807) a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-100276-97; REG-122450-98) designed to clarify the safe harbor by adding the ""formula test,"" an economic test. The proposed regulation provides that the safe harbor is unavailable unless the present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the residual interest does not exceed the sum of: (1) The present value of any consideration given to the transferee to acquire the interest; (2) the present value of the expected future distributions on the interest; and (3) the present value of the anticipated t...",background

"BACKGROUND. It is in the European society that local stakeholders use Europe‟s land and biodiversity sustainably (i.e. from CBD Article 2, “maintaining its potential to meet needs and aspirations of present and future generations”), while also embracing the many ways to restore biodiversity and other services from degraded ecosystems (Benayes et al. 2009). The potential for conservation and restoration of biodiversity is great, not only because 80% of European land is outside protected areas but also because there are large human resources using biodiversity. About 30 million Europeans are hunters and anglers, with recent increases in populations of most species they manage. Moreover, private spending on all biodiversity-dependent recreation, including gathering and watching wild species, is similar to the CAP budget (Section 3). How much conservation could an alliance of these people achieve, if encouraged and guided effectively? A key to restore biodiversity in Europe is to realise that wild resource beneficiaries, often seen as part of the problem for biodiversity, can also provide solutions through IUCN‟s recognition of sustainable use as a tool for conservation. Thus, conservation through use of biodiversity is a way to improve the conservation status of species or habitats through consumptive or non-consumptive use. However, conserving by using biodiversity is more complex than passing and enforcing protection laws. Extensive knowledge needs to be distributed, to help those who have already started to organise conservation management through hunting, angling, gathering and watching wild fauna and flora, and also to showcase their efforts as examples of best practise. People need to be engaged and motivated, for example to monitor and restore, not just to keep “hands off”. Marketing the TESS concept is a matter of engaging the huge human resource, of farmers, foresters, gardeners, hunters, anglers, gatherers, those who manage reserve or land access activities, and their many advisory organizations and consultants, in a similar way to that achieved for Dutch anglers in the following case example. A fine example of what can be achieved by integrating knowledge and different sectoral interests comes from the Netherlands. The Dutch government recently encouraged formation of Sportsvisserij Nederland, by combining a state regulatory arm for angling with voluntary angling organisations, endowed with a €40 annual license fee paid by all anglers over 18 years old.

By challenging American cities to use emerging transportation technologies to address their most pressing problems, the Smart City Challenge aimed to spark and spread innovation through a mixture of competition, collaboration, and experimentation. The Department committed $40 million for one city to demonstrate how advanced data and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies and applications can be used to reduce congestion, keep travelers safe, protect the environment, respond to climate change, connect underserved communities, and support economic vitality. The USDOT also called on public agencies to boldly envision new solutions that change the very face of transportation in their cities by closing the gap between rich and poor; capturing the needs of both old and young; and through smart design, bridging the digital divide so that the future of transportation meets the needs of all city residents, not just those who are technology savvy.

"BACKGROUND. A provision in the Social Security Act permits Medicare beneficiaries and physicians to contract privately outside of the Medicare program. Under the law as it existed prior to January 1, 1998, a physician was not permitted to charge a patient more than a certain percentage in excess of the Medicare fee schedule amount. A new provision, which became effective on January 1, 1998, permits physicians and patients to enter into private arrangements through a written contract under which the patient may agree to pay the physician more than that which would be paid under the Medicare program. A “private contract” is a contract between a Medicare beneficiary and a physician or other practitioner who has opted out of Medicare for two years for all covered items and services he/she furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries. In a private contract, the Medicare beneficiary agrees to give up Medicare payment for services furnished by the physician/practitioner and to pay the physician/practitioner without regard to any limits that would otherwise apply to what the physician/practitioner could charge. The purpose of this contract is to permit the patient (who is otherwise a Medicare beneficiary) and the physician to take advantage of this new provision in the Medicare law and sets forth the rights and obligations of each. This agreement is limited to the financial arrangement between Physician and Patient and is not intended to obligate either party to a specific course or duration of treatment. Patients and physicians who take advantage of this provision are not permitted to submit claims or to expect payment for those services from Medicare.

"BACKGROUND. The Company and Indemnitee recognize the increasing difficulty in obtaining liability insurance for directors and officers, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance. The Company and Indemnitee further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited. Indemnitee does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee may not be willing to continue to serve as an officer or director of the Company without additional protection. The Company’s Bylaws require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Company Law (the “DGCL”). The Bylaws expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and its directors and officers with respect to indemnification.

"BACKGROUND. The public works department is responsible for planning, building and maintaining the City’s infrastructure. The department is comprised of engineering, maintenance, and transportation divisions managing projects per the City’s capital improvement program and development service needs. Such projects may include master planning, development permit review, utility upgrades, building and park maintenance, and street and sidewalk repairs. Currently, public works projects are overseen staff engineers and inspectors, and supplemented with contract consulting services. The role of City surveyor is also currently provided through a master agreement. Over the years, the City Council has authorized the city manager to execute master agreements with consulting firms to augment staffing resources experiencing higher demand. Master agreements have been established by the City for short-term specialized services such as engineering, surveying, transportation, inspection and materials testing. The City’s current master agreements for engineering and surveying services were last authorized by the City Council in 2012, and expire at the end of fiscal year 2019-20. The last set of transportation master agreements was authorized by the City Council November 13, 2018, and may be extended through fiscal year 2024-25, so is not included in this authorization. On August 20, 2019, the City Council authorized the city manager to execute three-year master agreements for on-call architectural design, cost estimating and mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) design services. While cost estimating and MEP on-calls are not included in this authorization, staff recognized the need to expand the City’s architectural on-call support after further evaluation of current and projected workloads. Master agreements are an efficient tool for providing technical staff support and shorten the time needed to identify qualified firms while adhering to City purchasing policies. This enables the City to more quickly respond to needs by utilizing these consulting firms’ services on an as-needed basis for a specific activity. These services are temporary, and obtained only for the length of time needed to complete the tasks. Master agreements that involve on-call professional services only provide a list of qualified and vetted consulting firms. Once a master agreement is in place with the listed firms, staff interacts with these firms on an as-needed basis to find the most appropriate level of exp...",background

It is the intent of VA to maintain its long-standing practice of effective affiliations with educational institutions for the purposes of contributing to continued excellence in VA patient care and conducting joint academic programs that address health manpower needs throughout VA and the nation. An affiliation agreement promotes common standards for patient care, resident and student education, research, and staff appointments. The parties to the affiliation agreement also seek to avoid duplication of academic assets. The parties enter into this affiliation in a spirit of mutual benefit to be achieved through an equitable contribution of resources. The affiliation agreement is crucial to the partnership because it forms the philosophical and, in some cases, the legal basis for numerous specific agreements that may be executed between components of the affiliate and VA. In entering into any agreements, VA and the affiliate have a responsibility to comply with federal laws and VA policies concerning conflicts of interest.

"BACKGROUND. It has been shown that human tumors express a range of antigens that are overexpressed or uniquely expressed as compared to normal human adult tissues. This information can be exploited by inducing the immune system to generate an immune response to these TAAs by the use of recombinant vaccines expressing these TAAs. One of the major problems of this approach, however, is that many of these “self” antigens are weakly immunogenic. Thus, strategies must be developed in which the presentation of these antigens to the immune system results in far greater activation of immune responses than would be achieved naturally in the host. The generation of a vehicle that would enhance the presentation of a given TAA to the immune system would be a major step forward toward the development of a vaccine for the therapy and/or prevention of a range of human cancers. [*] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 406 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Yeast delivered tumor antigens activate innate immunity as well as antigen-specific immune responses. The use of yeast-based vaccines has been shown to be effective for cancer immunotherapy in preclinical animal models. A Phase I trial performed by GlobeImmune, Inc., outside the scope of this CRADA, demonstrated that administering GI-4000 yeast Tarmogens expressing a mutated Ras gene was well-tolerated (i.e. no drug-related serious adverse events; only adverse events confined to self-resolving injection site reactions and mild constitutional symptoms) and was immunogenic in 33 subjects with metastatic colorectal and pancreas cancer. Additionally, two other clinical studies, outside the scope of this CRADA, are being performed by GlobeImmune, Inc. A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial is underway at multiple centers to test GI-4000 mutated Ras-expressing yeast in combination with adjuvant gemcitabine in subjects with newly resected pancreas cancer. In addition, the GI-5005 yeast Tarmogen expressing two hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins is being tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial in subjects with chronic HCV infection. The interim results from that trial confirm that administration of yeast-based immunotherapeutic products is well-tolerated and immunogenic for yeast-expressed antigens in humans. The dual contributions to immune activation arise from the inherent “adjuvant-like” pro...",background

"BACKGROUND. A patient’s electronic medical record includes a variety of medical reports. Data in these reports provides critical information that can be used to improve clinical diagnosis and support biomedical research. For example, the Emory University Cardiovascular Biobank [25] collects records of patients with potential or confirmed coronary artery diseases undergoing cardiac catheterization, and aims to combine extracted data elements from multiple reports to identity patients for research. Report types include history and physical report, discharge summary, outpatient clinic note, outpatient clinic letter, coronary angiogram report, cardiac catheterization procedure report, echocardiogram report, inpatient report, and discharge medication lists. In increasing level of difficulty for data extraction, a clinical report is usually a mixture of semi-structured data, tabular based text, template based narration, and complex narration. Monitored Values: AO Diastolic - CV 65.00 02/30/2009 19:30 AO Systolic - CV 139.00 02/30/2009 19:30 LV EDP - CV 27.00 02/30/2009 19:31 …… Semi-structured data, as demonstrated in Figure 2.1, describes the value of data elements in the form of Attribute/Value pair. This format is highly readable and may be generated from a database directly. However, processing such data still requires an extraction tool as the original structure may not be preserved. Tabular based narration, as demonstrated in Figure 2.2, presents information in the form of tables. Similar to semi-structured data, it renders great human readability. But for the computer to interpret it properly is still a challenge. The coronary territory consisting of the mid/distal left anterior descending coronary artery and diagonal branches contained luminal irregularities. There is 90 % stenosis in the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Template based narration, as demonstrated in Figure 2.3, is a very common report form. The narrative style including its sentence patterns and vocabulary is consistent, direct, and resembles the use of the same template across different records. To extract information from this type of text (e.g., “mid left anterior descending artery”), specific linguistics based rules or constrains need to be applied. This may require non-trivial NLP expertise, especially when the number of attributes to be extracted is large. The patient is a healthy 51-year-old lady who had a diagnosis of breast cancer treated in 2001 with surgery. She had experience...",background

"BACKGROUND. As of April 7, 1999, the availability of S-8's streamlined registration process was restricted to deter the abuse of the Form to make sales to the general public through so-called ""consultants"" and ""advisors,"" and to eliminate registration on the Form to ""stock promoters."" S-8 eliminated a need to file a prospectus that duplicated information usually available to plan participants who were being compensated by the issuance of securities rather than cash, and it reflected the Commission's distinction between offerings made to employees for compensatory reasons and offerings made for capital raising. The Commission reasoned that the relationship of the employee to the issuer provided the employee with a familiarity of the issuer's business sufficient to justify the abbreviated disclosure, which would not be adequate in a capital raising transaction. The 1990 amendment included ""consultants"" whom the Commission found no reason to distinguish from regular employees, for bona fide non-capital raising services rendered. Abuses Since 1990, the Form has been used to distribute securities to the public without the protections to investors of registration under Section 5 of the Act. Securities are often issued to so-called ""consultants"" for nominal services, with pre-arrangements for exercise and distribution to the public in the underlying markets. Often the options granted are exercised to provide funds to the issuer or the proceeds of the sales are for the payment of debts of the issuer that are not related to any services provided by the consultants. The initial registration of the shares underlying these options did not register the public ""capital raising"" transaction which actually takes place via the secondary sales. In these instances, the employee or consultant acts as a conduit to the public, and the shares are not actually issued as compensation for services, for which the Form is solely intended. Securities have also been issued to consultants whose services are to promote the issuer's securities. This practice invites fraud by providing inexpensive compensation to person who hype the securities of the issuer and expand the issuer's market through resales by these and other persons. Through its recent amendments to Form S-8, the Commission has sought to curb these practices, while maintaining, to the extent possible, the initial intent of the Form, i.e., the registration of compensatory transactions between the issuer and consultants and advisors who re...",background

"BACKGROUND. Over the last 5 years, the Mayor smoothing Traffic Flow Policies have sought to maximise the Performance of London's road network and balance the often competing demands between general road traffic, public transport, cyclists, pedestrians and the desire to enhance the Urban realm. Much of this has been achieved by organising and mobilising our people and assets, focussed on a common unifying goal of improving journey time reliability (JTR). We have reversed the steady decline in JTR on London’s main corridors, the red routes. One of the ways that Network Performance (NP) has contributed to this is by: Making step changes in our capability to model traffic and pedestrian’s linked to our real time intelligent systems development and operations in the London Traffic Control Centre. This capability enables us to better understand, predict and manage the impacts of schemes and events. This ability was show cased during the Olympic and Paralympics, ensuring that a client group, the Games family consisting of all athletes and officials had reliable journeys, exceeding the 95% target yet still managing to keep London’s traffic flowing well. NP will continue to progress with existing initiatives to deliver further improvements in JTR. However, there is increasing recognition that, with more or less finite road capacity and the continually increasing demands placed upon it, more inspired and creative ideas will be needed to keep traffic moving whilst delivering on broader aspirations from many modal groups. Road Space Management faces an unprecedented level of network activity over the coming years. There is a need to predict, analyse, and subsequently operationally manage the vast number of large and small changes that are planned to take place across London’s road network over the business plan (to accommodate the predicted increase in growth and 1.25 million additional trips by 2018), to balance the significant competing demands between modes and to ensure that the journey times and reliability (JTR) for key modes (e.g. buses and cyclists) are protected. Road Space Management has an established three-tier operational modelling capability, comprising of: tactical, 3D micro-simulation and junction optimisation models. To date, these models have varying degrees of coverage across London’s three main geographic areas (Inner, Outer, and Central), preventing a consistent approach to modelling across Surface’s programme of schemes.
