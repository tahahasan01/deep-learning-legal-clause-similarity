"Support. You will have access to a support team from Grace Consulting, the UK’s premier independent consultant on care options. If required, experts from Grace Consulting will guide you through the complex decision making process for long-term care. 3 abc ESTATE PLANNING – IEP CARE & IEP CARE COVER BROCHURE Growing older can be an uncomfortable reality for many of us. However, with the UK’s over 65 population projected to grow by 33% between 2016 and 2030 and the over 85s population set to nearly double by 2030, living for at least twenty years after retirement is a very real probability. UK’s over 65 population projected to grow by 33% over 85s population set to nearly double At Ingenious, we believe that providing for potential costs of long-term care should be the first step in planning a financially secure future for you and your family. After all, today you may not know what these costs will be, but tomorrow they may have a significant impact on your financial position and the value of your estate. At its heart, the objective for care fees planning should be simple: ensuring that you can afford to live in the environment of your choice and protecting the value of your financial legacy from the potential costs involved. But this presents a conundrum. Set aside too little of your estate and you may find it difficult to live in the comfort you deserve, should you require care. Set aside too much and your beneficiaries may face a substantial tax bill as the unused funds may be subject to inheritance tax (IHT).
