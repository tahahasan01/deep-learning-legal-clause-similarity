"General Provisions. To be eligible, the employee must have worked for the Company for a period of at least 13 weeks preceding the estimated delivery date or have been employed by the Company for 13 weeks by the date on which the child comes into the custody, care and control of the parent for the first time. These leave provisions are available to all categories of employees. In addition, regular employees including regular part-time employees eligible for pregnancy leave or adoption leave are entitled to supplementary unemployment benefits (Ref. 11.4). Pregnant employees are entitled to pregnancy leave including those women whose pregnancies are terminated by still-birth or miscarriage within 17 weeks of the expected birth date (Ref. 11.2). Following the birth of the child, the employee is also eligible for parental leave. (Ref. 11.5) Adoption leave is available to the parent who is designated as the primary caregiver (Ref. 11.3). Parental leave is also available to such an employee (Ref. 11.5). Parental leave is also available to employees not eligible for pregnancy or adoption leave but who have become the parent of a child (e.g. an employee whose spouse has given birth to a child or the adoptive parent who is not the primary caregiver. Ref. 11.5). A leave extension is available to employees who take a pregnancy leave followed by a parental leave (Ref. 11.6). Service credit will be granted for the full duration of such leaves. Two weeks' notice is required for such a leave, except as noted in 11.2.2. The commencement date can be advanced or delayed upon the giving of a further two weeks notice. Similarly, the termination date can be advanced or delayed upon giving four weeks notice. Eligibility for such leave does not necessarily mean the employee is entitled to EI benefits. However, EI benefits may be available in the case of such a leave and employees should be referred to the nearest EI office to check their entitlement. The Company will continue for the duration of any such leave to pay the same share of the premiums for OHIP, EHB, Dental Plan, Life Insurance and Pension Plan that it would normally pay for the employee. This will not apply with respect to any benefit plan where the employee is normally required to make an employee contribution and he/she has given the Company written notice that he/she does not intend to pay such contributions. An employee going on such a leave may prepay his/her pension contributions prior to taking the leave or make up contributions ...",general-provisions
