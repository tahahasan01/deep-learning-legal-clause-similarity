"PREAMBLE. The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wis...",preamble

Heavy commitments must also be made in advance for raw materials and finished parts. For purposes of making these investments and commitments, planning production and estimating costs for setting prices, the Company assumes in advance an estimated volume of sales for each of its products.

Similarly, § 4-5.08 of the 1996 Appropriation Act, delegated nearly identical limited autonomy to the University as a whole for non-general fund capital projects. Pursuant thereto, in 1996 the Board of Visitors adopted a Policy Statement Governing Exercise of Post-Appropriation Autonomy for Certain Non-General Fund Capital Projects (the Existing Policy Statement). The Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act (the Act), Chapter 4.10 of Title 23 of the Code of Virginia, provides that, upon becoming a Covered Institution, the University may be delegated the authority to establish its own system for undertaking the implementation of its capital projects. In general, status as a Covered Institution is designed to replace the post-authorization system of reviews, approvals, policies and procedures carried out by a variety of central State agencies, and also the traditional pre-authorization approval process for projects funded entirely with non-general funds and without any proceeds from State Tax Supported Debt. The University's system for carrying out its capital outlay process as a Covered Institution is to be governed by policies adopted by the Board of Visitors. The following provisions of this Policy, together with the Policy Governing the Procurement of Goods, Services, Insurance, and Construction, and the Disposition of Surplus Materials adopted by the Board, and the Rules Governing Procurement of Goods, Services, Insurance, and Construction, which is attached as Attachment 1 to that Policy, constitute the adopted Board of Visitors policies regarding the University’s capital projects, whether funded by a state general fund appropriation, State Tax Supported Debt, or funding from other sources.

"PREAMBLE. The European Union’s strategic objective, defined at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, is to become the world most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy by 2010, capable of sustainable economic growth accompanied by a quantitative and qualitative improvement in employment and greater social cohesion. A safe and healthy working environment for agricultural workers is essential to maintaining agriculture as an attractive sector for workers, and hence for the competitiveness of the sector. The European Union’s social partners in agriculture, EFFAT and GEOPA-COPA, affirmed this point in October 2004 in a joint declaration made at the conclusion of a seminar on the health and safety of workers in the agricultural sector. The European Commission entered into an initial phase of consultation with the social partners in November 2004 concerning the protection of workers’ health and safety with respect to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Although no negotiations on this subject have been engaged in at the interprofessional level, the European Commission has indicated its intention of pursuing the legislative process, which is likely to lead to the adoption of a directive. The social partners in agriculture, GEOPA-COPA and EFFAT, have, however, agreed to engage in sectoral negotiations on MSD, with the aim of formulating a number of concrete proposals, in the hope that the Community authorities will take account of these in the context of the legislative process already under way. This is because: - they recognise the considerable frequency of musculoskeletal disorders in the sector, which has negative consequences for workers, employers, social security systems and hence for the whole society; - they agree that additional preventive measures are necessary and these must focus on improving knowledge about the risk in the public authorities, health services, social partners, employers and workers, and on setting up a concrete prevention policy in enterprises and at sectoral level; - They believe that the lack of comparable national statistics relating to work accidents and occupational diseases is an obstacle to the definition and implementation of a prevention policy at European level. Consequently, they call on the European Commission to devise a common statistical framework for all Member States, and to require Member States to regularly gather national statistical data conforming to this common framework and to communicate this information to an appropriate Eu...",preamble

The Corporation is aware that, in order to induce highly competent persons to serve the Corporation as Directors or in other capacities, the Corporation must provide such persons with adequate protection through insurance and indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the Corporation. The difficulty of obtaining adequate Directors' and officers' liability insurance in the current market has increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons. The Board of Directors of the Corporation has determined that (1) it is essential to the best interests of the Corporation's stockholders that the Corporation act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future, and that (2) it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Corporation contractually to obligate itself to indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will continue to serve the Corporation free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified. The Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and take on additional service for or on behalf of the Corporation on the condition that he or she be so indemnified.",preamble
