In the event that a final version of the Proposed Rule is adopted during the six (6) years following the Closing, then the purchase price will be recalculated and adjusted utilizing the formula set forth on Exhibit 2(a) and substituting the final Medicare reimbursement rates for the proposed Medicare reimbursement rates set forth therein (the ""Adjusted Purchase Price"").
