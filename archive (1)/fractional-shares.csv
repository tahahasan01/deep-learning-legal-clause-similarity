(a) No fractional shares of ConocoPhillips Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Burlington Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of ConocoPhillips Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.6, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of ConocoPhillips Common Stock representing such holder's proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of ConocoPhillips Common Stock equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of shares of ConocoPhillips Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by ConocoPhillips pursuant to Section 3.5(a) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of ConocoPhillips Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 3.5(b) (such excess being herein called the ""EXCESS SHARES""). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to ConocoPhillips that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the Certificates representing shares of Burlington Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE in the manner provided in the following paragraph.",fractional-shares
