The Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities which would otherwise be registered and underwritten pursuant to Section 2.2, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated among the Holders in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective amounts of securities requested by such Holders to be included in such registration. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, he may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter. If, by the withdrawal of such Registrable Securities, a greater number of Registrable Securities held by other Holders may be included in such registration (up to the limit imposed by the underwriters), the Company shall offer to all Holders who have included Registrable Securities in the registration the right to include additional Registrable Securities in the same proportion used in determining the limitation as set forth above.
