"Payment. Subject to any payment changes resulting from changes in the Index, Borrower will pay this loan in 35 principal payments of $5,703.52 each and one final principal and interest payment of $5,729.31. Borrower's first principal payment is due April 13, 2002, and all subsequent principal payments are due on the same day of each month after that. In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning April 13, 2002, with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that. Borrower's final payment due March 13, 2005, will be for all principal and all accrued interest not yet paid. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first to accrued unpaid interest, then to principal, and any remaining amount to any unpaid collection costs and late charges. The annual interest rate for this Note is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the annual interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender's address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing. VARIABLE INTEREST RATE: The interest rate on this Note is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an index which is the ""base rate."" The term ""base rate"" means the rate of interest designated by the Lender periodically as its Base Rate (the ""Index""). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans and is set by Lender in its sole discretion. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each day. The frequency of the rate change is further defined below in paragraph titled ""VARIABLE RATE CHANGE FREQUENCY"". Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well. The Index currently is 4.750% per annum. The interest rate to be applied to the unpaid principal balance of this Note will be at a rate of 1.000 percentage point over the Index, resulting in an initial rate of 5.750% per annum. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the effective rate of interest on this Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by law.",payment
