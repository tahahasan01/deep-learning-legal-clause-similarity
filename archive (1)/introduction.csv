"Introduction. Modern smart metering networks are one of the stepping stones in the evolution of smart grid (SG) networks and in renewable and distributed energy resource management systems. Unlike traditional metering systems, the infrastructure of modern smart metering relies typically on advanced information communication technologies (ICT). Smart metering networks will provide new opportunities for better control and management on energy production/consumption. Therefore, the future energy grid can operate, control and manage more efficiently and reliably. In a smart metering network, a smart meter (SM) is an important enabler that utilises two-way communication to send/receive consumption data or commands from a service provider (SP) and then to various entities, e.g., energy supplier, distribution network operator (DNO) and others, as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the increasing deployment of SMs in homes will provide many notable features, e.g., monitoring and control of energy consumption within the home area network, and communicating energy pricing information to consumers [1]. Smart metering provides various notable features, but it also poses various security and privacy challenges. For instance, recently three power companies experienced a massive cyberattack that disrupted the smooth functionality of the power grid and resulted in an energy blackout in a region for several hours [2]. Such verified attack incidents serve as prominent demonstrations of the significant risks to utility companies. Moreover, to meet the demands of energy consumption and generation, both customers and utility SPs need to exchange two-way information. In this scenario, an adversary can easily tamper with or capture the flow of information (i.e., wireless packets), which may affect Energies 2018, 11, 2662; doi:10.3390/en11102662 www.mdpi.com/journal/energies various use-cases, e.g., imbalance demand and supply systems, revenue losses, etc. Moreover, SMs can be captured physically as they are installed outside homes. As a SM usually collects and stores energy usages in its memory, the attacker can easily compromise a SM and dig out the information stored in it. This stored information may compromise the privacy of an individual, i.e., daily habits, sleeping patterns, and other activities. Moreover, as suggested in recent papers, under the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) model [3,4], an attacker can even use the credentials that are stored in a meter and can impersonate other non-compromised e...",introduction

"Introduction. The Functional API (FAPI) is used by vendors to expose board-level functionality. FAPI exposes the functionality specific to each board, as such, it is expected that the set of functions exposed will vary just as the network processing elements on different boards vary. While variance in the set of exposed functions is expected, for each type of function the methods used and the semantics of the function is expected to be vendor agnostic and consistent. Thus, while one board might expose functionality for IPv4 forwarding and NAT, perhaps based on a programmable network processor, and another board might expose functionality for IPv4 forwarding and MPLS using a classification chip and QoS chip, the IPv4 functionality exposed would be the same, at least as to the syntax used. Differences might exist in capabilities (supported numbers of forwarding entries, maximum rate of forwarding, etc.) but not in syntax. The same method would be used to add a forwarding entry, using the same data structures. In order to expose the variation in functions provided by different boards the FAPI model defines two sets of APIs. These are the FAPI Topology Discovery APIs and the FAPI Logical Function Block APIs. The FAPI Topology Discovery APIs are used to learn the presence of types of functions on a device and acquire handles used to configure instances of those functions. The learning aspects of the FAPI Topology Discovery APIs are expected to be used in scenarios where a blade is “hot plugged” into a system and the control plane must learn the type of blade it is. The handle retrieval methods of the FAPI Topology Discovery APIs are used both in “hot plug” scenarios and in static configuration scenarios, and allow a client program to programmatically acquire handles for use in configuring the tables which control forwarding device behavior. The FAPI Logical Function Block APIs are used to configure LFB resources and associate resources between LFBs. For example, they can be used to configure Data Path functions such as IPv4 forwarding, MPLS forwarding, tunneling in conjunction with IPv4, etc. The FAPI LFB APIs are specific to different LFBs and will be discussed in separate contributions.",introduction

"Introduction. The BellSouth Service Quality Measurement Plan (SQM) describes in detail the measurements produced to evaluate the quality of service delivered to BellSouth’s customers both wholesale and retail. The SQM was developed to respond to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1996 Section 251 (96 Act) which required BellSouth to provide non-discriminatory access to Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC)1 and their Retail Customers. The reports produced by the SQM provide regulators, CLECs and BellSouth the information necessary to monitor the delivery of non-discriminatory access. This plan results from the many divergent forces evolving from the 96 Act. The 96 Act, the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) Order (Docket 7892-U 12/30/97), LCUG 1-7.0, the FCC’s NPRM (CC Docket 98-56 RM9101 04/17/98), the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) Order (Docket U-22252 Subdocket C 04/19/98), the Florida Public Service Commission Order (Docket 000121-TP), numerous arbitration cases, LPSC sponsored collaborative workshops (10/98-02/00), and proceedings in Alabama, Mississippi, and North Carolina have and continue to influence the SQM. The SQM and the reports flowing from it must change to reflect the dynamic requirements of the industry. New measurements are added as new products, systems, and processes are developed and fielded. New products and services are added as the markets for them develop and the processes stabilize. The measurements are also changed to reflect changes in systems, correct errors, and respond to both 3rd Party audit requirements and the Tennessee Regulatory Authority. This document is intended for use by someone with knowledge of telecommunications industry, information technologies and a functional knowledge of the subject areas covered by the BellSouth Performance Measurements and the reports that flow from them. Once it is approved, the most current copy of this document can be found on the web at URL: http:// pmap.bellsouth.com in the Documentation/Exhibits folder. Each month, preliminary SQM reports will be posted to BellSouth’s SQM web site (http://pmap.bellsouth.com) by 8:00 A.M. EST on the 21st day of each month or the first business day after the 21st.

"Introduction. Reputation mechanisms have been proved to be successful methods to build multi-agent systems where agents’ decision-making processes to select partners are crucial for the system functioning [1][7][10]. In those systems, agents ex- change their opinions about third parties to better select partners to interact with. In organisational environments, those mechanisms may also be useful for agents, since organisational structures, such as roles or norms can be used in order to estimate other participants’ behaviour. Thus, integrating those organi- sational concepts into reputation mechanisms seems to be a promising approach to improve agents’ decision making processes. To cope with the interchange of opinions, many different reputation mecha- nisms have been proposed in the literature [7][10][13]. We can distinguish among two different types, namely: i) centralised and ii) distributed. Both types have been proved to suffer from some important problems, such as: newcomers prob- lems, lack of reliability in information exchanging, etc. [12]. To tackle with these problems, hybrid reputation mechanisms – combining centralised and distributed approaches – might be considered as a convenient technique [6]. In [12] we put forward a hybrid reputation model for organisations with a few strokes of the brush. We claimed, in that paper, that reputation fluctuates by the effect of norm fulfilment and violations, and that reputation values must be justified somehow by including, for instance, the norms that have been previously violated and the facts that have violated the norms. After that, in [5] we focus deeper on the dis- tributed part, dealing with agents’ information exchange, exploring the scenario of supply chains’ formation. In the present work we present a formalisation of the centralised approach so completing the model. In this paper we introduce the concept of reputation-based agreement as the cornerstone of the centralised module of the hybrid reputation mechanism. An agreement is usually defined as a meeting of minds between two or more parties, about their relative duties and rights regarding current or future performance. Around this concept new paradigms have been emerged [2][3] oriented to increase the reliability and performance of agents in organisations by introducing in such communities these well-known human social mechanisms. With this in mind, we propose a novel approach for the meaning of reputation. From a centralised point of view, a reputation-...",introduction

"Introduction. In late July 1996, the entrances to Plateau and Camps des Sapins, the two main mines in Thio, were blockaded by the commune’s Kanak inhabitants. Blockades were also placed on the ore transfer belt in nearby Thio Mission and on a Japanese ore carrier, the Tango Gracia, which was in the process of being loaded by its Filipino crew. The stand-off between the Thio coutumiers (‘customary representatives’) and the company Société Le Nickel (SLN) lasted two weeks and culminated in a wide-ranging written agreement which, despite being local in scope, went beyond the context of work and touched on environmental and social issues, the question of the control of resources, and the redistribution of mining revenues (see Filer 1997; Bainton 2009). 1 This study was carried out as part of a research program financed by the National Centre for Technological Research, under the title ‘Nickel Politics between Local Governance and Corporate Governance: The Comparison of Mining and Industrial Development in New Caledonia’. I should like to sincerely thank Jean-Michel Sourisseau for his critical and constructive reading of an initial version of this text, and Susan Cox for translating it into English. Thio, a commune located on the east coast of South Province, was the country’s ‘nickel capital’ for a long time, and SLN, which was established in 1880 and based in Thio during the interwar period, enjoyed a dominant position in the production and processing of nickel in New Caledonia.2 The town of Thio was also one of the focal sites of les événements (‘the events’), a period of violent clashes between 1984 and 1988 that combined elements of civil war between the Kanak separatists and New Caledonian loyalists with the Kanak decolonisation struggle, so the location and protagonists in this particular tale are not without significance. Equally significant is the unfolding of this social movement—the blockade itself, the willingness to extend or escalate the conflict beyond the boundaries of the mine site and then the eventual agreement. Finally, the discursive structure of this conflict as a conflit des coutumiers also merits some explanation. I shall start from the hypothesis that this conflict and the resulting agreement mark a turning point in local mining governance. This chapter will describe the configuration of actors, issues and discourses involved in the conflict, and will situate it in the previous history of local conflicts and in relation to the changes in mining affai...",introduction

"Introduction. Pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization from a Federal Mutual Savings Bank to a Federal Mutual Holding Company, American Savings Bank of NJ (the ""Bank"") converted to the mutual holding company form of organization in 1999 with no stock offering. Pursuant to the Mutual Holding Company Plan of Reorganization, the Bank became a federal stock savings bank, which had all of its stock owned by American Savings, MHC (the ""Mutual Holding Company""), a federal mutual holding company. Pursuant to a plan of reorganization, the Mutual Holding Company acquired all of the stock American Financial Group, Inc. (the ""Stock Holding Company""), a federal stock holding company, which acquired all of the stock of the Bank. On February 10, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Bank, the Stock Holding Company and the Mutual Holding Company, by at least a two-thirds vote, resolved to adopt this Plan of Stock Issuance (the ""Plan""), pursuant to which the Stock Holding Company proposes, pursuant to the laws of the United States of America and the Rules and Regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (""OTS""), to conduct a stock offering of up to but less than 50% of the aggregate of the total voting stock of the Stock Holding Company. In adopting the Plan, the Board of Directors has determined that the Stock Offering is advisable and in the best interest of the Bank, the Stock Holding Company, the Mutual Company and its members. The Stock Offering will enable the Stock Holding Company and the Bank to increase its capital through the issuance of capital stock without undertaking a full conversion from the mutual to the stock form of organization. The Stock Offering will not foreclose the opportunity to effect a conversion of the Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to the stock form of organization in the future. The Stock Offering will significantly increase capital and enable the Bank to further grow through internal expansion, the possible acquisition of other assets, branch offices, financial institutions, possible diversification into other related financial service activities and other purposes and will further enhance the Bank's ability to render services to the public. The mutual holding company structure also will allow the Bank to minimize over- capitalization by providing the flexibility to raise capital through the issuance of stock in a manner designed to meet the Bank's growth needs, rather than in a single stock offering as required in a standard mutual-to- stock convers...",introduction
"Introduction. Cloud computing is a model aimed at providing ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Cloud services are accessible over the Internet and hosted on a set of virtual machines running over a grid of physical machines in a datacenter. Virtual machines can be created, removed or migrated depending on the workload and availability of physical machines (cloud elasticity). In this context, Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract that defines a level and a type of QoS between a cloud provider (e.g., Amazon, Google) and a cloud client at any cloud level (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) [3]. According to [4], cloud characteristics (elasticity and SLA) imply new obstacles for computer science and modify classical hypotheses for dis- tributed algorithmic. Since applications in a cloud share resources, concurrent accesses to them might be critical and should be controlled in order to avoid inconsistencies. In other words, accesses to such resources are considered critical sections and, therefore, a mutual exclusion service for controlling their access must be provided by the Cloud. A mutual exclusion algorithm ensures that at most one pro- cess can execute the critical section (CS) at any given time. They can be divided into two families [5]: permission-based (e.g. Lamport [6], Ricart-Agrawala [7], Maekawa [8]) and token- based (Suzuki-Kazami [9], Raymond [2], Naimi-Trehel [10]). The algorithms of the first family are based on the principle that a node only enters a critical section after having received permission from all the other nodes (or a majority of them [7]). In the second group of algorithms, a system-wide unique token is shared among all nodes, and its possession gives a node the exclusive right to execute a critical section. Token-based algorithms present different solutions for the transmission and control of critical section requests of processes. Each solution is usually expressed by a logical topology that defines the paths followed by critical section request messages which might be completely different from the physical network topology. With regard to the number of nodes, token-based mutual exclusion algorithms present an average message traffic which is lower than that of permission-based ones. Thus, they are more suitable for controlling concurrent accesses to shared resources in Clouds whose number of nodes is often very large. Nevertheless, current mutex algorithms are not suitable for Cloud...",introduction

"Introduction. The Company wishes the Indemnified Person to serve as a Director of the Company and the Indemnified Person is willing to accept such position with the indemnification and other rights provided hereby. In recent years, litigation seeking to impose liability on directors, trustees and officers of publicly held corporations and trusts has become more frequent. Such litigation is extremely expensive to defend. In many cases, defense costs exceed the financial means of individual defendants. Further, the possibility of liability for extremely large sums is a deterrent to persons accepting positions of responsibility with a public corporation or trust. The Indemnified Person is deeply concerned regarding this situation, as well as the adequacy of the indemnification available under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, as amended.

"Introduction. Canada’s automotive assembly and parts industry is our country’s most important high- technology, value-added, export industry and employs thousands of people directly and indirectly. It makes a crucial contribution to family incomes, productivity growth, and foreign trade performance. Because of the high productivity of the industry and because of the strong linkages between assemblers, parts producers, and the thousands of companies which supply them (with everything from components to materials to services), every new job in an assembly or parts facility ultimately generates several additional jobs for Canadians. Automotive manufacturing is one of Canada’s only industrial “success stories,” and has made a crucial contribution to diversifying our economy away from an exclusive reliance on the production and export of natural resources and energy. For all of these reasons, the auto industry holds an immense economic and social importance to Canada. Within this context, Magna and the CAW are motivated by the shared goal of not only preserving but expanding Canada’s automotive sector through high-performance work practices; investments in both capital and human resources; effective and just labour relations; world-class quality, productivity, and reliability; developing and renewing top-quality skilled trades; and continuing to support and enhance social and environmental sustainability. Moreover, both Magna and the CAW have made significant contributions over the years to the development of a distinctly Canadian identity in our auto industry. Magna is the largest automotive manufacturer (measured by employment) in Canada. It has pioneered new technologies, new products, new forms of work organization, and new forms of workplace democracy. The CAW is Canada’s largest private-sector trade union. It became an independent Canadian organization in 1985, and since then has pioneered more effective and democratic union principles and practices, and contributed importantly to the evolution of a more authentic and democratic Social unionism. In Canada, Magna and the CAW already have an effective and productive working relationship, both in Magna’s existing CAW-represented facilities, and through our cooperation in bodies such as the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council and related forums. This gives us a special shared interest in continuing to build a more well- rounded, economically and financially successful domestic auto industry. Despite its past successes,...",introduction
"Introduction. As a result of changing population demographics, an increasing number of older patients are undergoing surgery. It is estimated that in 2020, the number of surgical procedures performed in persons aged 65 years or older in the United States will be 14% to 47% higher (dependent on specialty) than in 2001 [1]. Importantly, more than 40% of the patients in this age group experience a major postoperative complication [2], of which postoperative delirium is among the most common [3]. Postoperative delirium is associated with worse outcomes in older patients but can be prevented by tailored interventions that address a number of modifiable risk factors [4]. Therefore, current guidelines recommend routine preoperative assessment of delirium risk in this age group [3]. For adequate assessment of postoperative delirium risk, reliable risk stratifica- tion instruments are essential. Ideally, a risk stratification instrument correctly identifies older surgical patients who are at increased risk of postoperative delirium and are likely to benefit from preoperative and postoperative interventions to prevent delirium [4]. Several risk stratification instruments for delirium have been developed since the early 1990s [5–15]. Most of them are based on well-known risk factors for delirium, such as high age, cognitive impairment and alcohol abuse, and were found to have a very good to excellent performance. For some risk stratification instruments, the positive predictive value for incident delirium was 83 percent or higher [8, 11, 13]. Nevertheless, the generalizibility of many of these risk stratification instruments can be questioned because their performance has only been investigated in highly specific patient populations such as, for example, patients undergoing cardiac surgery [13], or patients with elective hip or knee arthroplasty [9], or hip fracture [10]. Furthermore, the validity of several risk stratification instruments has been tested in only one or two independent validation samples since their development [9– 12]. Therefore, the performance and relevance of current risk stratification instruments for delirium is still unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate in an independent validation sample, the performance of commonly used risk stratification instruments for post- operative delirium in older patients. The study sample included a total of 292 persons aged 50 years or older who underwent elective or emergency surgery. Methods Study population The s...",introduction

"Introduction. This Safe Harbor Agreement (Agreement) is made and entered into on the day of 2005, by Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW or Permittee) and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (Service); hereinafter collectively called the “Parties.” This Agreement implements the Service’s Safe Harbor Agreement final policy (FR 64:32717) and final regulations (FR 64:32706) as revised (FR 69:24084), in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements of section 10(a)(1)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). NDOW is the State agency responsible for the restoration and management of fish and wildlife resources within Nevada’s lands and waters. These resources include 109,894 square miles of land, 667 square miles of water and 529 streams that flow 2,765 miles. There are 892 species of mammals, reptiles, fish, birds, and amphibians under NDOW jurisdiction. Of that number, 790 species are native and 64 are found only in Nevada. In order to most effectively meet these responsibilities NDOW has one State-wide office, three regional offices and 3 additional satellite offices. NDOW has been involved in Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi (LCT), a federally listed threatened species, management, restoration and recovery since the early 1970’s and reached a new level of responsibility after developing species management plans for the majority of LCT’s historic range (Sevon et al. 1999). These plans describe activities and direction designed to move LCT towards recovery and subsequent de-listing throughout its historic range. The Agreement encourages proactive conservation efforts by non-Federal landowners while providing them certainty that future property-use restrictions will not be imposed if those efforts attract LCT to their enrolled property or result in increased numbers or distributions of listed species already present. In return for voluntary conservation commitments, the Agreement will extend assurances to the landowner, which will allow future alteration or modification of the enrolled property to its original baseline conditions. Without this cooperative government/private effort, LCT would not otherwise occupy important recovery habitats in the foreseeable future. This Agreement serves as the basis for the Service to issue an Enhancement of Survival permit under ESA section 10(a)(1)(A) for the “take” of covered, listed species associated with the potential future return of the Cooperator’s enrolled lands to bas...",introduction

"Introduction. The case of Henry Molaison (H.M.) [1] taught us that there was a distinction between the location of short- and long- term memory storage in the brain. A bilateral medial tem- poral lobectomy removing the anterior part of H.M.’s hip- pocampi and other nearby brain regions resulted in an in- ability for H.M. to create new long-term memories (but he could still recall old memories), while leaving intact the abil- ity to form and recall short-term memories. This caused researchers to believe that encoding and retrieval of long- term memories was mediated by distinct systems and that memories may be formed in one location in the brain, but consolidated elsewhere. Sleep has been shown to support the consolidation of mem- ory [2]. During non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, thalamo-cortical spindles [3] and hippocampal sharp wave- ripples [4] have been implicated in declarative memory con- solidation [5–11]. Evidence [8, 9, 12, 13] suggests that long- term memory consolidation is coordinated by the generation of hierarchically nested hippocampal ripples (100-250 Hz), thalamo-cortical spindles (7-15 Hz), and cortical slow oscil- lations (< 1 Hz) enabling memory transfer from the hip- pocampus to the cortex. Consolidation has also been demonstrated in other brain tasks, such as in the acquisition of motor skills, where there is a shift from activity in prefrontal cortex to premotor, poste- rior parietal, and cerebellar structures [14] and in the transfer of conscious to unconscious tasks, where activity in initial unskilled tasks and activity in skilled performance are lo- cated in different regions, the so-called ‘scaffolding-storage’ framework [15]. Cortical oscillations are an important mechanism that en- ables information transfer in the brain. Experimental evi- dence has demonstrated improved communication between sender and receiver neurons when gamma-phase relation- ships exist between upstream and downstream populations [16–18]. Loss of theta-band coherence has been shown to result in memory deficits [19] and pharmacological enhance- ment can improve learning and memory [20]. Theoretical investigations support the idea that coincident spiking can allow neuronal populations to overcome their threshold and propagate spikes downstream [21–25]. Recent work shows that, by separating a neural circuit into a feedforward chain of gating populations and a second chain coupled to the gating chain (graded chain), graded informa- tion (i.e. information encoded in firi...",introduction

"Introduction. In vivo cellular imaging of the human retina is achieved by incorporation of adaptive optics (AO) technology into clinical ophthalmic imaging devices. Through measurement and instantaneous compensa- tion of wavefront distortions caused by ocular aberrations, AO devices improve resolution so as to make possible visualization of individual cone pho- toreceptor outer segments. Currently, several studies are registered on the clinicaltrials.gov website that use AO retinal imaging to measure secondary endpoints (NCT02317328, NCT02828215, NCT02826655, NCT01866371, NCT00254605, NCT02889185, NCT01846052, NCT02714816). However, there is no consensus on either the optimal methods of postacquisition image processing or the selection of sampling windows for cone density measurements. Macular diseases may present with multiple lesions that vary in size, number, and location between eyes or patients. While AO cameras have been shown to capture images successfully from the same retinal area over follow-up visits to follow progression of lesions with excellent accuracy in patients with stable foveal fixation,1 there often are a number of retinal lesions in several retinal areas that should be tracked over time, and fixation locus may drift due to foveal involvement by the lesion. Therefore, single AO images of 483 48 field size, derived from the current commercially available flood-illumination ophthalmoscopy system, the rtx1 camera, are inadequate for documenting macular disease severity or progression. To visualize photoreceptors in the entire macular region, multiple AO images with overlapping regions are required to create a wide-field AO montage.2 However, this process is time- and labor-intensive. Furthermore, commercial cone analysis software (AODetect; Imag- ine Eyes, Orsay, France) can process only the raw 483 48 single AO images and not the reconstructed wide- field AO montage. The effort and time required for postprocessing is even greater for images from an AO scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) system where the field size can be smaller than 18 3 18. Hence, several previous studies have used single AO images showing regions of interest by directing the patient’s gaze through an internal fixation target.3–5 Subse- quent single AO images taken with the same gaze direction are used for monitoring progression at the same retinal location. However, fixation drift, micro- saccades, and other factors that affect fixation stability and location potentially can alter ...",introduction

"Introduction. In languages that show explicit agreement for both arguments of a transitive clause, the morphology expressing this agreement system is typically located in distinct nuclear elements (heads) in the configurational superstructure defining the extended projection of the lexical category V (cf. Grimshaw 1991). Of these two heads, one is relatively high in the functional structure, while the other is relatively low. The precise identification of the agreement-bearing heads depends to some extent upon certain typological properties of individual languages. This is the empirical side of the * I am grateful to Luciana Storto for working with me on the spurious antipassive (Hale & Storto 1997); to Beatriz Fernández for sharing a colloquium on eccentric agreement with me in the Spring of 1999 at MIT; to Pablo Albizu for inviting me to present some of this material at Vitoria-Gasteiz; and to Pablo Albizu, Beatriz Fernández, and Itziar Laka for question. There is also a theoretical side, of course, according to which the answer is framed in terms of particular linguistic models. For present purposes, I will refer to the heads in question as U for upper and L for lower. The upper head, in certain actual cases is C, the complementizer —and in some frameworks, the upper head is necessarily identified with C. Empirically, however, U is not always associated with morphological material normally associated with the complementizer, as that is normally understood. In K’ichee’, for example, U is associated with aspectual elements, observationally, at least. In the majority of instances, the lower head L corresponds to the nuclear element traditionally identified as I(nfl), representing various inflectional elements, including tense, commonly labeled T and, in some languages, L reflects voice or transitivity. In languages with overt agreement, U and L may also be the loci of agreement morphology, as in the languages examined here. In this brief paper, a number of examples are cited in which the ‘normal’ association of arguments to agreement is disturbed, as a result of specific grammatical processes. In the majority of such cases, the processes at issue involve the extinction of agreement morphology in one of the heads, resulting in the circumstance in which the two arguments of a transitive clause, subject and object, are ‘in competition’ for the single agreement remaining. An example of what I have termed eccentric agreement is the situation in which an argument normally ass...",introduction
"Introduction. Much of recent research on key agreement deals with provably secure key exchange. Since this approach was pioneered by Bellare and Rogaway [1], different models were proposed [3, 5, 31, 7, 14, 17]. Among these models, the Canetti–Krawczyk (CK) [7] and extended Canetti–Krawczyk (eCK) [17] models (which are incomparable [10, 34]) are considered as “advanced” approaches to capture security of key agreement protocols; and security arguments for recent protocols are usually provided in the (e)CK models. Broadly, a security model specifies, among other things, what constitutes a security failure, and what adversarial behaviors are being protected against. The aim is that a protocol shown secure, in the model, confines to the minimum the effects of the considered adversarial behaviors. In the CK and eCK models, session specific information leakages are respectively captured using reveal queries on session states and ephemeral keys, which stores session specific information; the adversary is supposed to interact with parties, and to try to distinguish a session key from a randomly chosen value. A protocol is secure if an adversary controlling communications between parties, cannot distinguish a session key from a random value, unless it makes queries which overtly reveal the session key. Unfortunately, adversaries do not always behave as expected. When leakages on in- termediate results in computing session keys are considered, (e)CK–secure protocols often fail in authentication; and the widely accepted principle that an attacker should not be able to impersonate a party, unless it knows the party’s static key is not achieved. This makes clearly desirable a security model, which captures intermediate results leakages resilience, in addition to the security attributes considered in the (e)CK models. From [30], we have a hybrid security definition, which considers leakages on interme- diate results; however the model cannot be shown to encompass the CK or eCK models. In addition, the security definition from [30] considers intermediate results and ephemeral key leakages in separate settings. In this paper, we propose a strong security definition, the strengthened eCK (seCK) model, which encompasses the eCK model, and considers leakages on intermediate results in computing session keys. We also propose a new proto- col called Strengthened MQV (SMQV). The SMQV protocol provides the same efficiency as the (H)MQV protocols [18, 14]. In addition, because of its resilienc...",introduction

"Introduction. In July 2011 the Director General of NHS Scotland, NHS Board Chief Executives and representatives of ACPOS agreed to move towards a partnership arrangement for Custody Healthcare and Forensic Medical Services, whereby the services provided in the past by Police Forces under the Scottish Home Department Circular 7362 dated March 1950, should now be jointly enabled by Police and Health and delivered by NHS Boards in accordance with the letter to the Chief Constable of Police Scotland from the Scottish Government which replaces the above 1950 Circular 7362. In this context the Cabinet Secretaries for Health and Social Care and for Justice have now agreed the general approach being taken towards a transfer of funding and responsibility for the provision of healthcare and forensic medical services in police custody, based on the following:  Responsibility for the healthcare in police custody, as a function of Health Boards under the terms of the Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, will be the function and responsibility of Health Boards;  Forensic medical services should be delivered by the Health Boards but remain a function and responsibility of the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) under section 31 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012;  Reflecting these responsibilities, healthcare and forensic medical services should be delivered as part of a combined service to ensure efficient and effective public services;  Funding for healthcare in custody and forensic medical services should transfer from the police to Health Boards, via Scottish Government, at a level fair to both partners and agreed  Funding relating to forensic services may be subject to review by both parties, specifically as a result of legislation or technical developments.  Whilst working towards partnership agreements with Health Boards, the police will continue their current arrangements for the delivery of services.

The National Framework is to be used by practitioners to guide the development of BCA. A completed BCA will be used by decision makers to inform investment decisions. The National Framework will also be used by decision makers to assess whether or not a BCA has been conducted according to the agreed national approach. Decision makers include Ministerial Councils, Standing Committees, National Management Groups (through their consultative committees), the National Biosecurity Committee and sectoral committees, and individual jurisdictions. The purpose of a biosecurity BCA is to determine whether a proposed policy or action will deliver benefits to society that exceed any costs incurred and in so doing enable decision makers to prioritise biosecurity investments. In a BCA, the benefits and costs of policy impacts relate to well-being and are carefully defined in economic theory as arising from both the consumption and production of goods and services. These goods and services may be many and varied and can be both traded in markets or exist outside of traditional markets (‘non-marketed’), such as biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and so on. The essence of BCA is the comparison of the “with” scenario to the “without”, or base case, scenario and the identification and valuation of the incremental or marginal costs and benefits to the community. In other words, the societal benefits of a change are compared with the societal costs. Only when the aggregate benefits exceed the aggregate costs is a proposal considered to be economically feasible and desirable from a community-wide perspective, ignoring distributional impacts. Where there are numerous alternatives, the option with the greatest net benefit is considered to be optimal and preferred. Where policies are targeted at reducing risks to the environment or human health, a range of techniques can be employed to enhance the value of the analysis to decision makers. The key requirements of the National Framework (identified below) are designed to assist parties involved in biosecurity BCA achieve best practice standards and robust BCA analyses appropriate to the...",introduction
"Introduction. It is a common experience that noise is unpleasant and affects the quality of life. It disturbs and interferes with activities of the individual including concentration, communication, relaxation and sleep (WHO, 2000; WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2000; Schwela, 2000). Besides the psychosocial effects of community noise, there is concern about the impact of noise on public health, particularly regarding cardiovascular outcomes (Suter, 1992; Passchier-Vermeer and Passchier, 2000; Stansfeld et al., 2000). Non-auditory health effects of noise have been studied in humans for a couple of decades using laboratory and empirical methods. Biological reaction models have been derived, which are based on the general stress concept (Selye, 1956; Henry and Stephens, 1977; Ising et al., 1980; Lercher, 1996). Amongst other non-auditory health endpoints, short-term changes in circulation including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and vasoconstriction as well as stress hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine and corticosteroids) have been studied in experimental settings for many years (Berglund and Lindvall, 1995; Babisch, 2003). Classical biological risk factors have been shown to be elevated in subjects that were exposed to high levels of traffic noise (Manninen and Aro, 1979; Lercher and Kofler, 1993; Algers et al., 1978; Arguelles et al., 1970; Dugué et al., 1994; Marth et al., 1988; Rai et al., 1981; Schulte and Otten, 1993a; Verdun di Cantogno et al., 1976; Yoshida et al., 1997; Knipschild and Sallé, 1979; Eiff et al., 1981a; Goto and Kaneko, 2002; Eiff et al., 1974; Babisch et al., 1990; Babisch and Gallacher, 1990). Although not in all these studies other risk factors were controlled for consistently, the hypothesis emerged that persistent noise stress increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders including high blood pressure (hypertension) and ischaemic heart disease: - Sound/noise is a psychosocial stressor that activates the sympathetic and endocrine system. - Acute noise effects do not only occur at high sound levels in occupational settings, but also at relatively low environmental sound levels when, more importantly, intended activities such as concentration, relaxation or sleep are disturbed. The questions that need to be answered are: - Do these changes observed in the laboratory habituate or persist under chronic noise exposure? - If they habituate, what are the physiological costs? If they persist, what are the long-term health effects? The a...",introduction
"Introduction. Hemophilia A is an X-linked congenital bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency in functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the blood compartment. Recently, clinical advancements have been made using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) -based gene transfer for hemophilia B. However, a unique set of obstacles impede the development of a similar approach for the related and more common bleeding disorder hemophilia A (109). These obstacles include 1) inefficient biosynthesis of human fVIII (hFVIII) (98), 2) limited packaging capacity of rAAV (4.7 kb) (47; 110) which is exceeded by FVIII expression cassettes as B domain deleted (BDD) FVIII cDNAs alone are approximately 4.4 kb, 3) humoral immune responses to the transgene product (i.e. FVIII) (111), and 4) capsid-mediated cytotoxicity of the virus itself, which has been proposed to be as low as 2e12 vector particles (vp)/kg (112). FVIII is a large glycoprotein containing a domain structure (A1-A2-B-ap-A3-C1-C2) that is secreted at levels up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than other similarly sized secreted glycoproteins in vivo and in vitro. This low secretory rate has been spatially and temporally linked to inefficient posttranslational trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi (98; 113-117). The primary determinants of this biosynthetic limitation are specific amino acid sequences within the A1 and A3 domains of the molecule itself that cannot be overcome by standard transgene expression technologies such as more efficient DNA regulatory elements (e.g. promoters/enhancers), transgene copy number, targeted integration at genomic “hotspots” for transcription, and codon optimization. Instead, bioengineering of the FVIII molecule itself appears to be required to overcome inefficient secretion. We have developed such a bioengineered FVIII molecule (herein designated ET3 and previously referred to as HP47) using knowledge gained from the characterization of B-domain deleted (BDD) recombinant porcine FVIII (rpFVIII) (118; 119). Both rpFVIII and ET3 are secreted 10-100 fold more efficiently than other FVIII constructs through diminished interactions with ER resident chaperones and attenuated induction of the unfolded protein response (117-120). The enhanced secretory capacity of ET3 is enabled through the substitution of “high expression” rpFVIII sequences in the A1 and ap-A3 domains into recombinant human FVIII (rhFVIII), which, despite retaining 91 percent overall amino acid ide...",introduction
"Introduction. Existing literature on Haitian ethnopsychology provides rich detail on Vodou explanatory models, concepts of personhood, and the place of persons in the universe of the natural, social, ancestral, and spiritual (Brodwin 1996; Kiev 1961; Sterlin 2006). At the same time, when work on Haitian ethnopsychology explicitly engages mental health, it is most often through reference to fou (madness), a term that mental health practitioners often liken to schizophrenia and other psychoses (Desrosiers and St Fleurose 2002). Potential milder forms of mental distress and everyday suffering have not been adequately explored, despite ethnographic evidence of mild to moderate mental health disorders in Haiti (Khoury, et al. 2012), as well as epidemiologic evidence of a high burden of common mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries (Collins, et al. 2011; WHO 2008a). One of the primary challenges in exploring mental distress in Haiti is limited research that identifies and describes appropriate language with which to do so. Indeed, the French term santé mentale (mental health) appears to have no widely understood equivalent in Kreyòl. One way to engage locally salient forms of mental suffering is through exploring local explanations of distress, including idioms of distress (Hinton and Lewis-Fernández 2010; Kohrt and Hruschka 2010). Such idioms can prove equally or more useful than psychiatric categories in the identification of those suffering from mental illness (Bolton 2001; Kohrt and Harper 2008; Kohrt, et al. 2004). In this chapter, I explore the anthropological concept of idioms of distress and explore the example of “thinking too much” as an idiom that can both benefit mental healthcare communication in Haiti and provide insight into experiences and commentaries of structural violence. Concepts like “idioms of distress” have been of interest to anthropologists, cross- cultural psychologists, and transcultural psychiatrists for decades, though the terminology used to describe them has changed. The categories of experience and suffering that these various terms attempt to capture, which Charles Hughes describes as occupying “a kind of ‘twilight zone’ of psychiatric phenomena” (Hughes 1985:3), are conceptually useful examples of constructs that are of interest to anthropology broadly, such as the interplay of biology and culture in shaping experience, the universality of phenomena like mental disorders, and the role of culturally specific meaning for shaping ...",introduction
"Introduction. In FY2020 the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) in collaboration with the Discovery Analytics Center (DAC) at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT), and funded by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development, began developing a demonstration prototype system that uses multiple machine learning and data analytic methods on large- scale open data sources to identify new, developing, and/or undeclared nuclear programs. This report documents the definition of events of interest and a hierarchical structure that will be used in the forecasting system. This report will also guide the research team in development or use of existing semantic dictionaries that are instrumental to searching, parsing, and categorizing events [1] [2] [3]. In addition, various geolocations around the United States are identified for sensitivity and null case testing. A previous successful forecasting system [4] [5] that this project is adapting for use depended on rapidly evolving events in days and weeks where numerous events provide considerable training and learning data. Nuclear weapons program development is inherently a long evolving program over several years where many aspects overlap with nuclear power production without numerous examples for training data. In this case, each milestone along the path of a weapons program becomes an event of interest to the ultimate concluding event of a weapon prototype. A program milestone would occur only once in a geolocation such that after the milestone, the capability or activity can occur at will. For example, many locations have nuclear power reactors where spent fuel accumulates. To create the capability to reprocess the fuel, years of program development, design, and construction would occur before startup but once the facility is operating, fuel reprocessing can occur at-will. The event of interest would be reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, but several related events are expected to be defined or developed over time to improve the ability to differentiate or categorize discovery of nuclear related events that are associated with the reprocessing facility. Each step along the way of development and program decision making involves people and activities that make up smaller, identifiable events more readily found in open sources. The accumulation of the related event discoveries is hypothesized to indicate when the primary event of interest is under development, o...",introduction

"Introduction. The syntactic operation of Agree was ﬁrst introduced by Chomsky (2000, 2001) as a mech- anism for feature valuation between a probe and a goal. The subsequent two decades have given rise to a wealth of research seeking to understand this operation. The research on Agree has sought on the one hand to understand and reﬁne the characterization of the oper- ation itself. Another line of inquiry has sought to understand what the empirical coverage of this mechanism is and speciﬁcally how it may ﬁgure in phenomena of dependency formation that extend beyond the simplest cases of φ-feature covariance between a functional head and a DP. This dissertation seeks to further our understanding in both domains. With respect to understanding the detailed mechanics of the operation of Agree, the body of work following Chomsky (2000, 2001) has pursued a variety of directions, which has raised many issues and questions for the theory. The content of this dissertation will engage with several of the questions raised by the past two decades of work on Agree. One such question that has been explored is the nature of the structural relationship between the probe and goal. Under Chomsky’s original characterization of Agree, it was assumed that the probe must c-command the goal. Subsequent research has explored a variety of positions with respect to this assumption. For example, some have argued that instead the reverse relationship must hold: the goal must c-command the probe (Wurmbrand 2012a,b; Zeijlstra 2012; Bjorkman and Zeijlstra 2019, among others). Others have defended the more traditional assumption that downward probing (i.e. probing under c-command) is involved in Agree (Boˇskovi´c 2007; Preminger 2013, among others). Still others have argued that directionality of probing is variable (Baker 2008; Carstens 2016, among others). In this dissertation I will argue that even probe-goal relationships that may not straightforwardly appear to involve a probe c-commanding a goal can be reduced to general downward Agree under c-command. Another question that has grown out of the continued research on the nature of Agree is whether a single probe can interact with multiple goals. The original formalization of Agree assumed that a probe interacted only with the most local goal, with locality deﬁned in terms of “closest c-command” (Chomsky 2000: 122). While most models of Agree assume some similarly-deﬁned version of locality, a question that has been raised is whether a probe may ag...",introduction

"Introduction. This Framework Agreement uses a standardised pricing structure which, subject to Schedule J Call-Off Contract Ordering Procedures, allows Lead/Customer organisations to order the services they require. The charging structure was established as part of a competitive procurement exercise where the Cost Effectiveness award criteria weighting was 50% and the prices contained in these charging schedules therefore contributed significantly to the award decision. The Contractor must ensure that the competitive charges offered submitted as part of the competitive procurement exercise, resulting in the award to the Framework Agreement, are sustainable for the agreement term. The Contractor must ensure it retains the capability to provide all aspects of the service and must have in place a complete charging structure for the Lots they are awarded to for the Framework Agreement, whereby a price is provided for every bid field throughout the term of the Framework Agreement. At the outset or during the Framework Agreement it will be permissible for the Supplier to sub-contract aspects of the service provision to ensure a complete charging structure is maintained, but this will be subject to agreement with the Authority.",introduction

"Introduction. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (‘the Inter-American Court’ or ‘the Court’) has for several years now used interpretive tools as a means to expand its jurisdiction into new areas of international law which were originally thought to fall outside the domain of human rights. This article looks at how this process has taken place. Downloaded from ejil.oxfordjournals.org at New York University on November 2, 2010 Through the analysis of several case studies of ‘expansionism’ and activism by the Inter-American Court, I will try to distill the tools used by the Court in interpreting and applying the American Convention, the core instrument of the Inter-American system. The background question is the extent to which human rights can be thought of, in the Inter-American system, as a self-contained regime1 of international law in interpreting legal instruments, or if it is overall a part of the general international legal system. My contention is that the Inter-American system’s use of ‘external elements’ makes the case for it being part of the larger system of international law.2 In the long run, this supports the unity of international law, as opposed to its feared fragmentation.3 In order to attempt to prove this claim, this article will first look at the specific rules on interpretation of the American Convention, and then at the interpretation of the Convention in light of other instruments. This latter part will first explore the idea of the American Convention as part of general international law (something which has been discussed by the Court’s jurisprudence), and then proceed to case studies on expansionism, which constitute the bulk of the article. These case studies will look at several areas of international law, such as international humanitarian law, investors’ rights, and environmental law, which have not been originally thought as being part of the field of human rights, but which have become intermingled with the field in adjudicatory practice. It will also look at areas, such as economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) and the protection of cultural minorities and indigenous peoples, which, even though human rights concerns, have originally fallen outside the jurisdiction of most adjudicatory bodies. The analysis will be based almost entirely on the case law of the Inter-American Court, even though some reference to the case law of the Inter-American Commis- sion may be necessary at times. It is therefore an empirical and descriptive ...",introduction

"Introduction. In the Millennium Report, the Secretary-General of the United Nations highlighted that ”Support for the rule of law would be enhanced if countries signed and ratified international treaties and conventions”, but that many countries are unable to engage effectively owing to ”the lack of the necessary expertise and resources.” This handbook is intended, among other things, to respond to the need identified by the Secretary- General. In addition, it should be useful for negotiators working in other contexts, such as non-legally-binding instruments, including ministerial declarations. The handbook was prepared as a practical introduction to negotiating or working on Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) for those with little or no background, as well as a key reference tool for experienced negotiators. While the coverage of the subject matter is relatively broad, depth and detail are limited. It contains pertinent technical information in an accessible format, making no assumptions about the reader has any specific knowledge. But it is not written in ’plain language’. On the contrary, useful technical language is provided, used in context, and set out in a new glossary. The glossary, contributed by UNEP, is a major addition to this edition. The second edition also contains several new sections and many revisions. Increasingly, the work in the international environmental field is focused on implementation, more than on the development of landmark agreements. And it is, moreover, clear that this work must be ongoing. That is, while we can point to key milestones, MEAs are tools for managing relationships with the environment, for which there is increasing need. To deliver environmental results for the world, we need to continue to negotiate practical issues and technical rules for implementation of existing agreements, as well as to address gaps and promote synergies. The handbook begins with a brief history of MEAs and major conferences. It lays out the elements of MEAs, common provisions and how they work together; reviews the rules of the game, from the basics of treaty law to rules of procedure and finance; gives an overview of the playing field and the players, looks at structures and roles; provides approaches to drafting and strategic issues; surveys international cooperation issues; provides a synthesis perspective, looks at a typical day in negotiations, negotiation products, then a checklist and reference tools, including the new glossary.

Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements and prolonged muscle contraction, resulting in twisting body motions, tremor, and abnormal posture (Bressman et al. 2001). Early-onset generalized torsion dystonia (DYT1) is the most common and severe form of hereditary dystonia. DYT1 is autosomal dominant with a 30- 40% penetrance and the disease onset usually occurs between 1 to 28 years of age (Bressman et al. 2001). Most cases of DYT1 dystonia are caused by an in-frame 3-bp (GAG) deletion in the gene encoding protein torsinA, which results in the loss of a glutamate residue at position 302 or 303 (torsinA ΔE) (Ozelius et al. 1997). In addition, an in-frame 18-bp deletion in the torsinA gene resulting in the loss of amino acids F323- Y328 (torsinA Δ323-8) was found in three members of a single family with dystonia (Leung et al. 2001). Because of a concomitant mutation in the myoclonic dystonia (DYT11)-linked protein epsilon-sarcoglycan in two of these patients (Klein et al. 2002), it remains to be established whether the torsinA Δ323-8 mutation contributes to the pathogenesis of dystonia. TorsinA is a 332-amino-acid protein that is expressed in brain and multiple other tissues (Shashidharan et al. 2000). It is unclear why mutations in torsinA manifest mainly as a neurological phenotype. TorsinA contains an N-terminal 20-amino-acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal sequence (Hewett and Breakefield 2003; Liu et al. 2003), followed by a 20-amino-acid hydrophobic domain. Immunohistochemical studies in neurons reveal the presence of torsinA in the cytoplasm, neuronal processes and synaptic terminals (Shashidharan et al. 2000; Konakova and Pulst 2001; Walker et al. 2001; Walker et al. 2002; Augood et al. 2003; Rostasy et al. 2003; Xiao et al. 2004). TorsinA is widely believed to reside in the lumen of the ER (Kustedjo et al. 2000; O'Farrell et al. 2002; Kustedjo et al. 2003; Bragg and Breakefield 2004; Gonzalez-Alegre and Paulson 2004; Goodchild and Dauer 2004; Naismith et al. 2004). In contrast to the ER localization of wild-type torsinA, torsinA ΔE mutant protein was reported to co-localize with nuclear envelope (NE) marker proteins (Bragg et al. 2004; Gerace 2004; Gonzalez-Alegre and Paulson 2004; Goodchild and Dauer 2004; Naismith et al. 2004), and overexpression of torsinA ΔE mutant may lead to the formation of cytoplasmic perinuclear inclusions (Hewett et al. 2000; Kustedjo et al. 2000; O'Farrell et al. 2002; Bragg and Breakefield 20...",introduction

"Introduction. Body image can be defined as the intellectual reproduction people do with regard to their own physical image, however, it is not only related to body perception, but to a process that is built by the individual throughout life including a set of social, libidinal and physiological aspects1. In this perspective, the concept of body image comprehends three different dimensions: a perceptive dimension, which refers to observing the person’s own body, including aspects such as dimension and body weight; a subjective dimension, concerning satisfaction (or not) with a person’s own body; and a behavioral dimension, characterized by actions people perform or not based on how they perceive their physical appearance2. An individual’s perception concerning the body can be assessed in all of the moments throughout life. Because of its deep transformations, adolescence deserves special attention, because, at that stage in life, it is possible to expect that the aspects that are present in the three dimensions of body image (perceptive, subjective and behavioral) should be always revisited and reformulated. This is a relevant theme for public health, because, among other reasons, body image has been associated with different practices for body changes (weight loss or gain, muscle mass gain). Dietary habits and practice of physical activities are part of such changes (which may or may not be adequate in terms of health), as well as extreme practices, such as use of formulas, laxatives and vomit-inducing3-6. Therefore, in surveillance systems of risk factors to health involving adolescents in the world, including Brazil, body image has been one of the analyzed themes, assessed by means of questions related to their opinion on weight and body7-11. Up until now, no studies have been conducted to compare these questions, which becomes a challenge in terms of comparing body image indicators produced in the different systems. Besides questions about body image used in surveillance systems, another instrument has been adopted in epidemiological studies concerning body image among adolescents: the silhouette scales3,5,12, addressed to this population group. At first, they were conceived to analyze body image perception and dissatisfaction with body among adults13,14, but now some of these instruments have been adapted and validated for children and adolescents12,15-18. Further studies are necessary to inform about the psychometric characteristics of these scales for this populat...",introduction

"Introduction. In the fifteenth century the frontier of the Inca empire was pushed southward from Cuzco, Peru. The history of the conquest of the new territories is very complex. What is of interest here is the fact that the Quechua dialects which are spoken in the south of Peru, Bolivia and the north of Argentina are all closely related variants of the Cuzco prestige language, used by the Incas as a lingua franca. In Bolivia, the Quechua language has slowly spread over the country in the centuries after the conquest and has been mainly in competition with Aymara and later with Spanish. Lexical influence from these languages is obvious, but structurally the Bolivian Quechua dialects are almost identical to the Cuzco dialect, since both the morphology and the syntax have undergone only superficial changes. Nevertheless, between the verbal paradigms of these dialects a considerable number of differences can be observed. It will be shown that in Cuzco Quechua the expression of tense and agreement is highly transparent, while Bolivian Quechua has a good number of opaque and underspecified entries in its verbal paradigm.1 I will argue that a cluster of these differences can be attributed to a difference in the status of the morpho-syntactic category number. This is expressed separately in the Cuzco dialect, while it has been fused with person, at least for first and third person plural, in Bolivian Quechua. Another cluster of differences can be related to object marking. Two port-manteau suffixes which express the relation between a first or third person subject and a second person object are in a process of reinterpretation towards a suffix which only expresses second person object in Bolivian Quechua. 1 I would like to thank Pieter Muysken en Willem Adelaar for our discussions about the complex Quechua verbal paradigm and for comments on earlier versions of this article. For the Cuzco data I relied on Cusihuaman (1976) and Lefebvre & Muysken (1988) and the Bolivian data, which I checked and confirmed with my informants in Tarata, Bolivia are from Herrero & Sanchez (1978). For a more elaborate presentation of the paradigmatic variation I refer the reader to my thesis on Bolivian Quechua verbal derivation (van de Kerke 1996), financed by the Dutch Organization for Tropical Research (WOTRO). In the examples the following glosses are used: AC accusative, PST past, SudDis Sudden Discovery tense, NOM nominalizer, EUP euphonic, ob object, sub subject PL plural SG singular.

"Introduction. The purpose of the Least Chub Conservation Strategy (Strategy) is to describe specific actions and approaches required to expedite implementation of conservation measures for least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis). These actions will be implemented by the Least Chub Conservation Team (Team), which is comprised of representatives from each signatory to the Least Chub Conservation Agreement (Agreement). The goal of these actions is to ensure the long-term viability of least chub within its historic range. The general conservation approach focuses on two main objectives. The first objective is to eliminate or significantly reduce threats to least chub and its habitat. The second is to restore and maintain a minimum number of least chub populations throughout its historic range within designated Geographic Management Units (GMU) to help ensure the continued existence of least chub. The following document begins with a summary of current knowledge of least chub life history including population distributions, taxonomy, species descriptions, legal status, and ongoing threats to least chub. The subsequent sections describe conservation elements, which are specific management actions that will be implemented to reduce threats and expand least chub populations. The populations have been divided into separate GMUs along hydrologic drainages. Threats and conservation actions have been prioritized within each GMU in Utah. Lastly, the methodology of adaptive management and Strategy implementation is explained. The Bonneville Basin within Utah encompasses the area that was covered by ancient Lake Bonneville and which, today, lies within the Great Basin physiographic province of North America. The entire Great Basin province is distinguished geologically by its characteristically parallel north- south mountain ranges that are separated by broad, alluviated desert basins and valleys (Christiansen 1951). In Utah, the steep, gravelly slopes of these ranges are prominently marked by benches and other shore features of Lake Bonneville. Numerous springs are present at the base of the mountains (Bick 1966) and in the valley floors. Several aquatic species have maintained an existence as relict populations in these springs, including the least chub, Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), and several species of mollusks. Populations of these species, however, are rare and in some areas declining. The rapid deterioration of these aquatic environments, primarily from water devel...",introduction

"Introduction. Devon is the third largest county in England, covering 2,534 square miles. The county has over 750,000 residents, with a higher proportion of older people than the national average. It is also one of the most sparsely populated counties, with few large settlements and a dispersed rural population. There are 28 market towns and the city of Exeter, with a population of approximately 110,000 people. • An ageing population which is also growing faster than the national average, increasing future demand for health and care services • New towns such as Cranbrook and new housing developments in existing towns with a young population structure very different to the rest of Devon, and a different set of challenges relating to health-related behaviours, child health and sexual health and certain crimes. Community development and preventive approaches will be vital in these areas • Increasing financial pressures affecting local authorities, police forces, Clinical Commissioning Groups and other agencies requiring changes to traditional patterns of service provision to ensure health and care services, and other front line services remain accessible and affordable • A configuration of local authority and health organisations more complex than most other counties, with two-tier local authorities, and Clinical Commissioning Groups crossing local authority boundaries. This creates extra challenges in terms of the continuity of services, planning and effective partnership working • A sparse and predominantly rural population, creating additional challenges around access to health and care services and the need for sophisticated models of home-based care, outreach and work to reduce social isolation. The effective utilisation of local resources, voluntary / community organisations and community assets will be critical • Patterns of deprivation marked by isolated pockets and hidden need within communities and higher levels of rural deprivation, with groups experiencing health inequalities likely to be geographically dispersed. This creates additional challenges when addressing health inequalities and targeting services to those most in need. Rural deprivation can lead to an increased fear of crime and it is important for communities to work together to increase their resilience and support to one another. • A disparity between the quality of indoor and outdoor environments in Devon. According to the Indices of Deprivation 2015 over half the Devon population (54.55%) live in ...",introduction
"Introduction. Fusion power stations would provide large amounts of base load electric energy, burning deuterium-tritium fuel. An intrinsic characteristic of them, would be the extremely low level of fuel inventory in the burning chamber, and the low levels of after burn heat power density. Obviously, fusion power stations would neither burn nor produce any fissile material. The products of the fusion process itself are benign, so that tritium and the neutron activation of materials would be the only source of potential radiological hazards. With appropriate design, these favourable inherent features can be exploited to provide substantial safety and environmental advantages. These possibilities have been explored in a series of studies, within the European fusion programme, called the Safety and Environmental Assessments of Fusion Power (SEAFP). The first of these studies led to the publication in 1995 of the report on the Safety and Environmental Assessment of Fusion Power (SEAFP-1). The work carried out for SEAFP-1 confirmed the attractive safety and environmental characteristics of fusion power. The independent 1996 Fusion Evaluation Board endorsed the conclusions of SEAFP-1. The SEAFP-1 assessment also helped to identify the issues that needed further study and deeper understanding. Accordingly, a series of follow-up studies (called SEAL, SEAFP-2 and SEAFP-99) were launched that carried forward the work in this area until the end of 1999. These studies extended and improved the analyses and updated the specifications of the materials used in the designs. This report is an integrated summary report on the work performed within all these studies, which updates and extends the original SEAFP-1 report. All the assessments have been based on the same conceptual fusion power station designs with 3,000 MW of fusion power and an output of about 1,200 MW of net electrical power. These conceptual designs are identical in their physics assumptions, based on reasonable extrapolations from the results of present experiments. They differ in their engineering and materials technology. The two principal designs, here called “MINERVA-W” and “MINERVA-H”, were based on the two concepts for a key component (called the “blanket”) of the fusion power core of the plant, that are currently being developed in the European fusion programme. The blanket is the component of the power station where the energetic neutrons produced by the fusion process are slowed down and deliver their energy in...",introduction
