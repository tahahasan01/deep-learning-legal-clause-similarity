"Change of Control. “Change of Control” means a “change in the ownership of the Corporation”, a “change in the effective control of the Corporation”, or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Corporation.” A “change in the ownership of the Corporation” occurs on the date that any one Person, or more than one Person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Corporation that, together with stock already held by such Person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation. However, if such Person or group owns more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Corporation before a particular acquisition of stock, such acquisition shall not be considered to cause a “change in the ownership of the Corporation.” A “change in the effective control of the Corporation” occurs when either (i) any one Person, or more than one Person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition) ownership of stock of the Corporation possessing 30% or more of the total voting power of the stock of such Corporation; or (ii) a majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election. To avoid any confusion, it shall not be deemed a change in effective control of the Corporation under Section (i) above if a Person (or group) already owns at least 30% of the voting power before acquiring additional stock of the Corporation. A “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Corporation” occurs when one Person, or more than one Person acting as a group, acquires, during a 12-month period, assets that have a total gross fair market value of 40% or more of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Corporation immediately prior to such acquisition. An acquisition of assets shall not be considered a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Corporation” if the assets acquired are purchased by (A) a shareholder of the Corporation in exchange for or with respect to Corporation stock; (B) an entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation; (C) a Person, or more than one Person acting as a g...",change-of-control
