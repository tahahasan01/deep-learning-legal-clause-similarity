"Dispute Resolution. To expedite resolution of issues and control the cost of disputes, you and ViaSat agree that any legal or equitable claim relating to this Agreement, any addendum, or your Service (referred to as a “Claim”) will be resolved as follows: We will first try to resolve any Claim informally. Accordingly, neither of us may start a formal proceeding until at least 60 days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing (“Notice”). You will send your Notice to the address on the first page of this Agreement to the attention of the ViaSat Legal Department and we will send our Notice to your billing address. If you and ViaSat are unable to resolve the Claim within 60 days after Notice is received, then ViaSat and you agree to arbitrate any and all Claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:  Any Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, tort, or any other legal theory;  Any Claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement between us;  Any Claims that are currently the subject of a purported class action suit in which you are not a member of a certified class; and/or  Any Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court in the county of your billing address if permitted by the laws of such county. This Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. If the law allows, these agencies may seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that by entering into this Agreement, you and ViaSat each waive the right to participate in a class action and/or a trial by jury. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This Dispute Resolution provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Arbitration Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The Arbitration Rules are available online at adr.org,...",dispute-resolution
