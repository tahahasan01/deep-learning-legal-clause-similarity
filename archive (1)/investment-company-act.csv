If the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that the Issuer is required, but in violation of the Investment Company Act, has failed, to register as an investment company, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) investors in the Issuer could sue the Issuer and recover any damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which the Issuer is party that is made in, or whose performance involves, a violation of the Investment Company Act would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should the Issuer be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, the Issuer would be materially and adversely affected. When Notes are purchased or sold, several types of incidental costs (including transaction fees and commissions) are incurred in addition to the current price of the security. These incidental costs may significantly reduce or even exclude the profit potential of the Notes. For instance, credit institutions as a rule charge their clients for own commissions which are either fixed minimum commissions or pro-rata commissions depending on the order value. To the extent that additional – domestic or foreign – parties are involved in the execution of an order, including but not limited to domestic dealers or brokers in foreign markets, Noteholders must take into account that they may also be charged for the brokerage fees, commissions and other fees and expenses of such parties (third party costs). In addition to such costs directly related to the purchase of securities (direct costs), Noteholders must also take into account any follow-up costs (such as custody fees). Prospective investors should inform themselves about any additional costs incurred in connection with the purchase, custody or sale of the Notes before investing in the Notes.",investment-company-act
