Claims are established by Montclair's Workers' Compensation administrator, upon notification of injury or illness, usually through the ""Employer's Report of Occupational Injury or Illness"" form and the ""Workers' Compensation Claim Form (DWC 1)."" These two forms are completed only if an employee obtains medical attention; in cases of first-aid-type injury or illness or damage to City equipment, only Montclair's ""Supervisor's Report of Accident"" form is required. Occupational illness or injury should also be immediately reported to the Administrative Services Department. Most claims, if handled promptly and properly, will be resolved successfully and efficiently.",reporting-requirements
